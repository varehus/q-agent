	* Thoughts: Removed in favor of new TODO.

	* README: Remove content and refer to doc/manual.info instead.

	* agent.c (do_get): Would burn badly on a premature exit of the

	* agent.c (do_get): Use it here, too.

	* secret-query.c (main): New option '--no-global-grab' introduced,
	that prevents keyboard grabbing unless the window has focus.

2000-09-11  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secret-query.c (usage): Add two missing pieces of "\n\".

	* agent.c (main): --nofork is now the default, and the option is
	deprecated. New option --fork added to turn forking on again.
	Close stdout (and stderr unless debugging) even when not forking,
	so that normal usage inside eval is still possible.
	(agent): Exit gracefully on HUP, so that logging out now kills the

	Generate doc/Makefile.

	* apgp.c, agpg.c, agentlib.c, util.c: Include more stuff.

	* agent.c (do_get): Use asprintf() instead of snprintf() so we
	don't need to roll our own for yet another function.
	Fix some includes.

	* acinclude.m4: gettext macros copied from automake and fixed.

2000-05-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	(do_put): Requests containing unsupported flags fail.
	(forget_old_stuff): Would not set next_deadline correctly.
	(do_get): Implement FLAGS_INSURE.

	* client.c (main): "list" format changed so that comment is to the
	far right. Display the deadline as proper date/time, too.

1999-11-11  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* agent.c (next_deadline): New global variable, holds time when
	next secret has to be killed.

	options, influencing PUT's deadline and flags, respectively.
	(main): Change list format to include new attributes.

1999-11-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: <getopt.h> check had redundant definition.
	* acconfig.h: Remove here, too.

	* configure.in: Check for <inttypes.h>. If not found, check for
	unsigned {int, long} sizes.
	* agent.h: Either include <inttypes.h>, or try to define uint32_t
	yourself.
	Need to include "config.h".

1999-11-04  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (signed-dist): New rule, generates sig for dist.

	here. But do include <sys/types.h> in all cases.

	* 0.7 released.

	* secmem.c: ulong is not defined on all systems.

	* agent.h: <inttypes.h> should define `uint32_t' as per Unix98, so

1999-11-02  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* agent.h: Augmented requests and replies with magic numbers.
	Data structures heavily commented.
	All structures and enums typedef'd.

	on size of toplevel window.
	(grab_keyboard): Removed protection against multiple calls.
	(ungrab_keyboard): New function, cancelling a keyboard grab.

	(main): Include id in xgetpass prompt.

1999-10-14  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	PATH, too.
	* Makefile.am (install-exec-local): Set cap_ipc_lock permitted on
	installed binaries, if possible.

	* agent.c (xdup2): New function, dup2 with error handling.
	(move_fd): New function, moves fds.
	(store): New function, abstracted out from do_put.
	(do_put): Use it.
	(do_get): If secret was not found, and DISPLAY is set, try to
	query the user about it. If successful, store it.
	(main): Route standard file descriptors to /dev/null rather than
	just closing them. The latter would confuse children.

1999-10-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* gtksecentry.c, gtksecentry.h: New files, being slightly modified
	versions of GTK+'s gtkentry.[ch], spiffed up to use secure memory.

 	(log_fatal): New function, logs to stderr, and dies.

1999-09-08  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secmem.c (log_info): New function, logs to stderr.

	* agent.c (agent): select() expects the number of fds, not the
	highest fd. So remember that number.

	* agent.c (agent): Don't use FD_SETSIZE, which is not defined on
	all systems. Remember the number of the highest descriptor
	instead.

	* configure.in: Replace getline() instead of getdelim() because
	this is the function we really need. Still check for getdelim(),
	though - there are systems out there where this is provided, but
	getline() is not.

1999-09-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* 0.6 released.

	* configure.in: Bump version.

	check" always builds all in . first.

1999-08-21  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secret-query.c: Include "config.h".

	* agent.h (reply_list_entry, reply_list): New reply structures.
	* agent.c (send_list_entry): New function.
	(do_list): First send number of entries, then each entry via
	send_list_entry().
	* agentlib.c (agent_list): Read entries returned by LIST request.
	* client.c (main): Output all entries returned by agent_list().

	space for the reply, but offer a simple way for simple requests.
	(agent_get): Allocate secure memory.

	* agent.c (main): Moved secmem_init() after the fork, since that
	seemingly munlock's all pages.
	Drop priviledges just in case somebody wants to install this
	suid-root.
	Flush stdout.

	* agpg.c (find_id): Would reorder arguments.
	Initialize opt_version.
	(main): Initialize secure memory.

	* Makefile.am (agpg_SOURCES): Link with secure memory module.

	* agent.c, client.c: Forgot the terminating NULL in long options.
	Fixed the program names in usage and version output.

1999-08-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* 0.4 released.

	Check for missing getdelim.

	* cgpg: Removed, obsoleted by agpg.
	* Makefile.am: Here, too.

	* agpg.c (find_id): New function.
	(main): Use it.

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Put GTK_FLAGS and GLIB_FLAGS here. It
	is the easiest way for sources needing it, and it won't hurt those 
	that don't.
	(agent.o): Explicit command removed accordingly.

1999-08-04  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: Need double quoting in nested AC_MSG_WARN.

	* client.c (xgetpass): If no tty is available, but a DISPLAY is,
	fork off "secure-query" to read the secret.
	Put the fgets into a loop that keeps reading until all of the
	secret is read.

	* client-test: Unset DISPLAY, so that "secret-query" is never used.

1999-08-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* agpg.c: New file, first cut at a C version of the gpg wrapper,

	stomach).
	* Makefile.am: Add it to built programs.
	(LDADD): New default.
	(secret_client_LDADD): Removed, since it was identical to default.

1999-08-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secret-query.c: New program, queries the user for a password.
	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Added it.
	* configure.in: Check for GTK+, build "secret-query" only when
	that is available.

	* cgpg: Extra argument for ID is no longer necessary. cgpg will
	scan the gpg args for switches that affect user-id, and determine
	the right key itself. Per convention, the key-id is used by "GET".

	* configure.in: The project name is now "secret-agent".

	* Makefile.am: "agent" & "client" renamed to "secret-agent" &
	"secret-client", respectively.
	* client-test: Adapt to new names.

	* Thoughts: Removed discussion of other names.
	Added indication of which things already work.

	For the sake of compatibility, provide a definition for AF_LOCAL,
	PF_LOCAL, if missing.
	* agentlib.c: Ditto.

1999-07-28  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (client_SOURCES): Add "secmem.c", "memory.h".

	* client.c (xgetpass): Use secmem_malloc() instead of RYO.

	* agent.c (main): Init secmem.
	Make --debug switch cumulative.
 	(cleanup): Shutdown secmem.
	(do_put): Use secmem for storage of secrets.
	(do_delete): Use secmem_free(). Since this wipes the memory on its 
	own, wipe() is superflous now.
	(agent): Use secmem for inbound requests.
	(delete_secret): New function, takes part of do_delete's
	functionality.
	(do_put): Use it to remove old versions stored under the same id.
	(do_delete): Use it to delete secrets.

	* memory.h: New file.

	* secmem.c: New file, snarfed from GnuPG and modified slightly.

	* acinclude.m4: New file.
	* configure.in: (ALL_LINGUAS): Expanded list of available
	languages. Most of them only have a few translations from gpg,
	tough ...
	getopt_long test was commented out for debugging,
	and left such. Fixed.
	Check for mlock.
	* acconfig.h: Comment HAVE_BROKEN_MLOCK.

	* cgpg: A space was missing.

	* i18n.h: New file, centralizing the gettext macro defs.

	* agent.c (BLIND): New macro, that blinds out a secret if debug
	level is too low.
	(do_put): Use it.
	(do_get): Use it.
	Include i18n.h.

	* agentlib.c: Include i18n.h
	
	* client.c (usage): New function.
	Usage-message made gettext-friendly.
	(xgetpass): Use perror() instead of fprintf().
	(main): Use it.
	Make comment an optional argument of PUT.
	Include i18n.h.

1999-07-26  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (client_LDADD): Add lib/libutil.a for portability.
