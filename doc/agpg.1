.SH NAME
agpg \- wrapper around gpg that provides passphrases for you
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBagpg\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] [ \fB\fIFILE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
When \fBq-agent\fR is running, \fBagpg\fR can
be used instead of \fBgpg\fR, and it will try to get all
necessary passphrases from the agent instead of asking you
directly.
.PP
Since all arguments are handed off to \fBgpg\fR
verbatim, the interface of \fBagpg\fR is exactly the same as
that of \fBgpg\fR.
.PP
The following \fBgpg\fR options will influence the
behaviour of \fBagpg\fR itself:
.TP
\fB-u, --local-user \fINAME\fB\fR
informs \fBagpg\fR that it should provide the
passphrase for the key indicated by
\fINAME\fR.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
\fBagpg\fR will output its version, too.
.TP
\fB--passphrase-fd \fIFD\fB\fR
prevents the querying of passphrases from the agent -
you will have to provide the passphrases yourself on the
given \fIFD\fR. Its usage with \fBagpg\fR is
discouraged.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBAGENT_SOCKET\fR
\fBagpg\fR will use this variable to find the socket for
communicating with the agent.
