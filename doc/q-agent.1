.SH NAME
q-agent \- store secrets in a safer way
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBeval `\fR\fBq-agent\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]\fB &`\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Start an agent to hold secrets. Settings necessary to
communicate with the daemon are printed to standard output. These should
be captured, and evaluated in your shell, like shown in the
synopsis.
.PP
Once \fBq-agent\fR is started, the
programs listed under "See Also" can be used to store and retrieve secrets.
.TP
\fB-c, --csh\fR
output commands compatible with csh-like shells - the
default is to print bourne-shell compatible commands
.TP
\fB-d, --debug\fR
turn on debugging output, can be used up to two times
to generate even more information - level two will output secrets,
too, so beware!
.TP
\fB-q, --query-options \fIOPTIONS\fB\fR
if a secret is queried on demand, the
\fIOPTIONS\fR are passed to the program used to query it.
The only viable option right now is \fB--no-global-grab\fR (or
\fB-g\fR in short), which prevents grabbing of the keyboard until
the query window is focused. (See
\fBsecret-query\fR(1) for details.)
.TP
\fB--fork\fR
fork into the background - this will instruct the
agent to act just like a daemon, i.e. it keeps on running, even after
you log out.
.TP
\fB--help\fR
print a usage synopsis, then exit
.TP
\fB--version\fR
print version information, then exit
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBAGENT_SOCKET\fR
Other programs will use this variable to find the socket for
communicating with the agent. \fBq-agent\fR outputs
code to set it to the right value.
