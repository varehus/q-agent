.SH NAME
q-client \- interact with a q-agent
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBq-client\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fBput\fR \fB\fIID\fB\fR [ \fB\fICOMMENT\fB\fR ]


\fBq-client\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fBget\fR [ \fB\fIID\fB\fR ]


\fBq-client\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fBdelete\fR [ \fB\fIID\fB\fR ]


\fBq-client\fR [ \fB\fIOPTION\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fBlist\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
When \fBq-agent\fR is running,
\fBq-client\fR can be used to communicate with it.
Secrets can be listed (with list), stored (via
put), fetched (using get), and
finally removed (by delete)
.PP
All commands except list will have the
\fIID\fR as their first argument. This is an
arbitrary string used to discern different secrets. Its content is up
to you, but it usually pays off to stick to a convention. For example,
when dealing with PGP/GPG passphrases, I recommend using the
associated key id.
.PP
The following options are valid in combination with all
commands:
.TP
\fB-d, --debug\fR
turn on debugging output
.TP
\fB--help\fR
print a usage synopsis, then exit
.TP
\fB--version\fR
print version information, then exit
.SS "LIST"
.PP
The list command simply prints the
meta-data of all known secrets, each on one line. The lines contain
the following fields seperated by TAB: 

the identification

the date/time in ISO format, when the secret
will be forgotten, or none if there
is no deadline

options enabled on the secret
(insure, for example)

an attached comment
.SS "PUT"
.PP
To store a secret with the agent, the
put command is used. It takes an
\fIID\fR, optionally followed by a
\fICOMMENT\fR, as arguments.
.PP
The following options apply to put:
.TP
\fB-i, --insure\fR
every time the agent is queried about this secret,
it will ask for permission by popping up a dialog window.
Note that if the agent is not running with access to a
windowing system, the secret is virtually
inaccessible.
.TP
\fB-t, --time-to-live \fIN\fB\fR
instructs the agent to automatically forget this
secret in \fIN\fR seconds.
.TP
\fB-q, --query-options \fIOPTIONS\fB\fR
if the secret is queried with the help of an external
program, the \fIOPTIONS\fR are passed to that program.
The only viable option right now is \fB--no-global-grab\fR (or
\fB-g\fR in short), which prevents grabbing of the keyboard until
the query window is focused. (See
\fBsecret-query\fR(1) for details.)
.SS "GET"
.PP
Retrieval of a secret (specified by an
\fIID\fR) is accomplished with the
get command. The secret is printed to
\fBSTDOUT\fR, \fBunless\fR
\fBSTDOUT\fR is a terminal - to prevent dumb
errors.
.SS "DELETE"
.PP
delete instructs the agent to
immediately forget the secret tagged by
\fIID\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBAGENT_SOCKET\fR
\fBq-client\fR will use this
variable to find the socket for communicating with the
agent.
